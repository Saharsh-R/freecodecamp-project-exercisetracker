# [Exercise Tracker](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/exercise-tracker)
If you want to see it working check this - [Repl.it Exercise Tracker](https://replit.com/@SaharshR/boilerplate-project-exercisetracker)

The postman collection which I made while working for this project is also in this git repository as a json file. The `basefull` variable was named to `http://localhost:3000/api/exercise` because I was testing it locally on my terminal.
